#Exercise 8: Iterate a given list and check if a given element exists as a key’s value in a dictionary. If not, delete it from the list

#Given:
#roll_number = [47, 64, 69, 37, 76, 83, 95, 97]
#sample_dict = {'Jhon':47, 'Emma':69, 'Kelly':76, 'Jason':97}

#Expected Outcome:
#After removing unwanted elements from list [47, 69, 76, 97]

sample_dict = {'Jhon':47, 'Emma':69, 'Kelly':76, 'Jason':97}
roll_number = [47, 64, 69, 37, 76, 83, 95, 97]

roll_number = [i for i in roll_number if i in sample_dict.values()]

print('After removing unwanted elements from list', roll_number)
